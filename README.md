# Detecting smartphone usage while driving using object detection: An advanced approach
Also known as **texting and driving**, this is a very dangerous form of distracted driving, which significantly increases the risk of traffic accidents.
The purpose of this dissertation is to build an advanced system to recognize texting while driving, using different heuristics for classifying frames and new objects.

The whole system is based on a YOLO object detection network (Ultralytics YoloV8).
